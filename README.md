# Chirp - The 'Code Along' Chris McCord Version

This is a tutorial by Chris McCord (https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI), 
I have removed the code that Chris McCord inputs in the video.  All of the other goodies that allow for the great icons that Chris uses as well as other code that is not shown.  This allows you to code along and have the exact returns that are shown in the video.

This repo is complete with everything up to the 'mix phx.server' command at the 1:35 point in time, including the LiveView routes are in place.

To start Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Start coding along with Chris after the 1:35 time in the video.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
