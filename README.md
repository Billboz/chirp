# Chirp - The 'Code Along' with Chris McCord Version

This is a tutorial by Chris McCord (https://youtu.be/MZvmYaFkNJI), 
I have removed the code that Chris McCord inputs in the video excluding some of the post_component.ex file that code runs off screen.  All of the other goodies that allow for the great icons that Chris uses as well as other code that is not shown is intact.  This allows you to code along and have the exact returns that are shown in the video.

This repo is complete with everything up through the 'mix phx.server' command including the LiveView routes are in place. The "mix setup" takes care of both "mix ecto.create" and "mix ecto.migrate".
You can start coding after the 1:50 point in time. 

To start Phoenix server:

  * Setup the project with `mix setup`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`
  * Start coding along with Chris after the 1:50 time in the video.

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
